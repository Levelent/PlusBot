Florin would be proud.

### Setup:

Before running anything, make sure you have the following packages installed via pip:
- discord.py (v1.5.0)

Then, you'll need a [discord API token](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) in order to run.

Replace the placeholder token in `token_default.json`, and rename the file to `token.json`.

The main entry point of the script is `main.py`.
